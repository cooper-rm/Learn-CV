# OpenCV Fundamentals

Learn the basics of image loading, manipulation, and visualization with OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

- **[02 — Environment Setup](../02_environment_setup/)** — Python environment ready
- **[03 — Python & NumPy Basics](../03_python_numpy_basics/)** — Array manipulation skills

## Overview

OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) is the most widely used library for classical computer vision tasks. This section covers:

1. Reading and writing images
2. Color space conversions
3. Basic image operations (resize, crop, rotate)
4. Drawing on images
5. Simple image processing (blur, threshold, edge detection)

## Why OpenCV?

- **Industry standard** for computer vision
- Efficient C++ backend with Python bindings
- Extensive documentation and community
- Covers classical CV, which complements deep learning approaches

## Key Concepts

- BGR vs RGB color ordering
- Image coordinate systems (row, col) vs (x, y)
- In-place vs. copy operations
- Common image formats and their properties

## Self-Assessment

You're ready to move on if you can:
- [ ] Load, display, and save images
- [ ] Convert between color spaces
- [ ] Resize and crop images
- [ ] Apply basic filters
- [ ] Draw shapes and text on images

## Next Steps

After completing Getting Started, you're ready for:
- **[02 — Image Classification](../../02_classification/)** — Start your CV journey!
