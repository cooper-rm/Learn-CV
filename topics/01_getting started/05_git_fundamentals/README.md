## Why Git for Research?

- **Track experiments** — Know exactly what code produced which results
- **Collaborate** — Work with teammates without overwriting each other's work
- **Backup** — Your code is safe in the cloud
- **Reproducibility** — Others can replicate your exact setup

## Key Concepts

- Repository, commits, branches
- Staging area and working directory
- Remote vs. local repositories
- Pull requests and code review
- `.gitignore` for data files

## Self-Assessment

You're ready to move on if you can:
- [ ] Clone a repository
- [ ] Create commits with meaningful messages
- [ ] Create and merge branches
- [ ] Push to and pull from remote
- [ ] Resolve a simple merge conflict

## Next Steps

Git skills are used throughout your research. Return here when you need a refresher!
