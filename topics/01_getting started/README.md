# Getting Started

Welcome to the Computer Vision Research Group! This section will get you up and running quickly so you can start working on your research project.

## Who This Is For

This guide is designed for MSDS students joining the CV research group. Whether you're new to computer vision or have some experience, start here to ensure you have the foundational skills needed for research.

## Learning Path

Work through these sections in order:

### [01 — Overview](./01_overview/)
Start here to understand what computer vision is and explore the research directions available in this group.

### [02 — Environment Setup](./02_environment_setup/)
Set up your development environment with Python, PyTorch, and essential CV libraries.

### [03 — Python & NumPy Basics](./03_python_numpy_basics/)
Review Python fundamentals and NumPy array operations essential for CV work.

### [04 — OpenCV Fundamentals](./04_opencv_fundamentals/)
Learn the basics of image loading, manipulation, and visualization with OpenCV.

### [05 — Git Fundamentals](./05_git_fundamentals/)
Learn Git version control and GitHub collaboration workflows for research projects.

## Time Estimate

A student with basic Python experience can complete the Getting Started section in **1-2 days**. Take your time with the fundamentals — they'll pay off as you dive into advanced topics.

## After Getting Started

Once you complete this section, you're ready to explore specific CV topics based on your research interests. We recommend starting with:

1. **[Image Classification](../02_classification/)** — The foundation of modern CV
2. Then follow the suggested paths based on your project focus
